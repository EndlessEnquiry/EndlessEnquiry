Well met, I'm @EndlessEnquiry aka. "Jerre" and am looking to collaborate in the free software community with other like-minded people.

I'm currently working on creating lightweight linux ISOs for other people to enjoy, particularly focusing on the easy implementation of Window Managers like DWM.

Feel free to use and evaluate the configurations I will be providing on my GitHub page! :)

Cheers!
